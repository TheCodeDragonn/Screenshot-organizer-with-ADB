# Description: This script is used to organize screenshots on an Android phone based on the content of the screenshot. It uses pytesseract to extract text from the screenshot and then categorizes the screenshot based on keywords in the text. The screenshots are then moved to folders on the phone based on their category. The script uses ADB to interact with the Android phone and requires pytesseract to be installed.
